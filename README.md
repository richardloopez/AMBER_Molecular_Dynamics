# AMBER_Molecular_Dynamics
-This repository is composed by different codes for better treatment of AMBER Molecular Dynamics Data: /n
-Most of them use cpptraj tool to generate the output, but implementing a user-friendly interface, without missing parameters
-In the attached .pdf a guide for each script is provided
-total_hbond_interactions.py has special interest because it performs hbond between selected residues in each selected frame (told by the user), a functionality not implemented by cpptraj. It offers a .csv archive as output.
